Graph display process implemented with .NET 8.0 + ASP.NET Core (MVC) + Highcharts + Dapper + SQLite.
I added Highcharts to an ASP.NET Core app (MVC) for .NET 8.0 and created a sample that displays a graph of SQLite database data obtained through Dapper.
Commercial use of Highcharts is subject to a fee.
The graph shows the relationship between Japan's successive cabinets and the Nikkei average stock price.
I can say this because we live in an age where modern monetary theory (MMT) and macroeconomic policies are understood, but if the Bank of Japan had bought all of the debt that arose in the 1990s when the Japanese bubble burst, there would have been no bubble burst in Japan, the city of Yubari would not have gone bankrupt, and Japan would still be "Japan as No. 1".
The Ministry of Finance is still collapsing the Japanese economy.
Even if the Chinese economy is sluggish due to the collapse of the real estate bubble, if the Chinese government bought all of the debt of the real estate industry and local governments, which is said to be 1 quadrillion yen, the Chinese economy would recover immediately.

## Asp.NetCore/Src_NET8_DapperSQLite/

Implementing DB processing with .NET 8.0 + ASP.NET Core (MVC) + Dapper + SQLite.
I created a sample that uses the Dapper + SQLite NuGet package to perform DB processing on a SQLite database from an ASP.NET Core app (MVC) in .NET 8.0. Dapper is the mainstream for OR mapping.
